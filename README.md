#bus_timetable_rails
===================

##Bus timetable
###User stories to start out with:
*As a bus system operator, I want to add bus stations, so that I can show where all of the buses will go.
*As a bus system operator, I want to add bus lines, so that I can track which lines go to which stations.
*As a bus rider, I want to view a bus line, so that I can see the stations where it stops.
*As a bus rider, I want to view a bus station, so that I can see which buses come to it.

###Then, work on this story:
*As a bus system operator, I want to check boxes assigning a line to certain stations, so that I don't have to go to a separate page to tell the line what stations it goes through. (To start off this story, go through the HABTM Checkboxes Railscast and implement it in your code. Make sure to read the second-to last comment on the comments page. Then, read the Rails API documentation on collection_check_boxes and refactor.)
